  Use the GitHub CLI to issue a new release as a part of your CircleCI pipeline.
  In this example, on every commit (merge) to the "main" branch, we will use the config to specify the desired tag and issue a release.
  Add a Context containing your GITHUB_TOKEN or set a project-level environment variable.
